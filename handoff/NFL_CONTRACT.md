# NFL Conversion Contract (shared between backend + iOS)

App: **Gridiron StatScout** (working name), NFL analytics/percentiles app cloned from the
Baseball Savvy StatScout codebase. Same architecture: nightly Python ingest → Supabase →
SwiftUI iOS app reading `player_snapshots` + `player_game_logs` via PostgREST.

## Supabase
- URL: `https://qwkmpwnhrejsuplcwxrb.supabase.co` (dedicated "Football" project, separate
  Supabase account — apply schema via `psql` with `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, not the CLI token).
- Creds file: `~/.football_credentials` (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD).
- Tables (already created):
  - `player_snapshots` — same shape as baseball (id bigint, season int,
    season_type `REG`/`POST`, PK (id, season, season_type); name, team, position,
    handedness, image_url, player_type, source, metrics jsonb, standard_stats jsonb,
    games jsonb).
  - `player_game_logs` — PK (player_id, season, season_type, game_date, player_type); columns
    `plays` (was plate_appearances) and `touches` (was batted_ball_events), metrics jsonb.
  - `player_recent_form` — league-anchored 3/5/8-week aggregates. PK
    (player_id, season, season_type, player_type, window_weeks).

## Data source
- `nflreadpy` (nflverse). Verified working in `backend/.venv` (Python 3.14):
  - `load_player_stats([season])` — weekly rows, 145 cols (passing_*, rushing_*, receiving_*, def_*, fg_*, ...).
  - `load_nextgen_stats(stat_type='passing'|'rushing'|'receiving')` — NGS advanced metrics; week 0 rows = season aggregate.
  - `load_schedules([season])` — `game_id` → `gameday` date mapping.
  - `load_players()` — headshots, positions.
- No API key needed. Data is a static parquet mirror, cloud-IP friendly (works in GitHub Actions).

## Season
- NFL season label = starting year. Season 2025 ran Sep 2025 – Feb 2026 and is the most
  recent complete season. Rule: `season = year if month >= 9 else year - 1` (today, July 2026 → 2025).
- `STATCAST_SEASON` env var name is kept (workflow compatibility) and overrides.

## Player IDs
- nflverse `player_id` is GSIS, e.g. `"00-0034796"`. DB id is bigint:
  `id = int(gsis_id.split('-')[-1])` (e.g. 34796). Collision-free in practice.

## player_type (snapshot + game log rows)
Position-group based, lowercase: `"qb"`, `"rb"`, `"wr"`, `"te"`, `"def"`, `"k"`.
Derived from `position_group`. One snapshot row per player, season, and season type.
`REG` and `POST` are ranked separately.

## Metric categories (jsonb `metrics[].category`, exact strings)
- `"Passing"` — QBs. Metrics (id → label): pass_yards→"Pass Yds", pass_tds→"Pass TD",
  cmp_pct→"Cmp%", ypa→"Y/A", int_rate→"INT%" (inverted), passer_rating→"Rating",
  passing_epa/dropbacks→"EPA/Play", cpoe→"CPOE", avg_time_to_throw→"Time to Throw",
  aggressiveness→"Aggressiveness", avg_intended_air_yards→"Intended Air Yds", sack_rate→"Sack%" (inverted).
- `"Rushing"` — RBs + rushing QBs. rush_yards→"Rush Yds", rush_tds→"Rush TD", ypc→"Y/C",
  rushing_epa/carries→"EPA/Rush", rushing_epa→"Rush EPA", rush_first_downs→"Rush 1D", explosive_rush_rate→"Explosive%",
  fumble_rate→"Fumble%" (inverted), rush_yoe (NGS rush_yards_over_expected)→"RYOE" if available.
- `"Receiving"` — WR/TE/RB with targets. receptions→"Rec", rec_yards→"Rec Yds",
  rec_tds→"Rec TD", yac→"YAC", target_share→"Target Share", wopr→"WOPR", racr→"RACR",
  receiving_epa/targets→"EPA/Tgt", receiving_epa→"Rec EPA", catch_pct→"Catch%", avg_separation→"Separation" (NGS),
  avg_yac_above_expectation→"YAC+" (NGS).
- `"Defense"` — DEF players. Advanced (PFR `advstats_season_def`, 2018+):
  def_pressures→"Pressures", def_hurries→"Hurries", def_qb_knockdowns→"QB KD",
  def_cmp_pct_allowed→"Cmp% Allowed" (inverted), def_yds_per_tgt_allowed→"Yds/Tgt Allowed" (inverted),
  def_rating_allowed→"Rating Allowed" (inverted), def_missed_tkl_pct→"Missed Tkl%" (inverted).
  Traditional: tackles→"Tackles", sacks→"Sacks", def_ints→"INT",
  passes_defended→"PD", forced_fumbles→"FF", tfl→"TFL", qb_hits→"QB Hits".
  PFR is keyed by `pfr_id`, joined to GSIS via `load_players()`. The season table has no
  `season_type`, so **advanced defence is regular season only**. Coverage rates need
  ≥ 20 targets and Missed Tkl% needs ≥ 20 combined tackles, else they are nulled rather
  than ranked on a two-target sample. `standard_stats` carries "Tgt Allowed" as the
  weighting denominator.

## Metric coverage by season

Every season 2000–2025 is present with ~1,100–1,300 players. What varies is which
*advanced* metrics exist, and it varies because of the sources, not by choice. This
table is the reference; `MetricCoverage` (Swift) and the constants in `ingest.py`
mirror it, and the app shows a short note in-app for any season with a gap.

| Metric group | Seasons | Bound by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All traditional counting stats, EPA/Play, EPA/Rush, Rush EPA, Rec EPA, Sack%, INT%, Explosive%, Fumble%, Y/A, Y/C, Rating | 2000–2025 | none; pbp runs from 1999 |
| CPOE | 2006–2025 | pbp air-yards tracking starts 2006 |
| Target-derived receiving: Target Share, WOPR, RACR, Catch%, EPA/Tgt | 2000–2002, 2009–2025 | nflverse `targets` blank 2003–2008 |
| RACR (partial) | 2000–2002 | receiving air yards incomplete pre-2006 |
| NGS passing/receiving: Time to Throw, Aggressiveness, Intended Air Yds, Separation, YAC+ | 2016–2025 | Next Gen Stats era starts 2016 |
| RYOE | 2018–2025 | NGS rushing-over-expected starts 2018 |
| Advanced defence (Pressures, Hurries, QB KD, Cmp%/Yds/Rating Allowed, Missed Tkl%) | 2018–2025 | PFR advanced defence starts 2018 |

CPOE is derived from the weekly feed's `passing_cpoe`, attempt-weighted to a season
figure, **not** from NGS `completion_percentage_above_expectation`. The two are
different expectation models (r ≈ 0.86, ~1.6 points apart over a season), so using the
weekly one throughout avoids a definitional seam at 2016 that would corrupt every
year-over-year CPOE comparison. NGS remains a fallback where weekly is absent.

## All Time (career rollup)

`backend/rollup_all_time.py` writes one extra snapshot per player under the sentinel
season **`0`**, aggregating 2000→current into a career line, with percentiles ranked
inside the career cohort. Stored as a season rather than an app-side mode so the
leaderboards, Teams, Compare and the player page all get it with no special-casing.

- Rendered as "All Time" via `SeasonLabel`; never as `"0"`.
- Career qualification is far higher than a single season (≈ 3 starting years):
  1500 attempts / 500 carries / 300 targets (200 receptions fallback) / 48 games.
- Re-reads the weekly feed rather than summing stored snapshots, which would compound
  rounding and drop every season a player missed the single-season cut.
- Trends excludes it: rolling 3/5/8-week windows are a within-season question.
- The API's historical fetch is an `or=(season.eq.0, and(season.gte.2000, season.lt.current))` —
  a plain `gte.2000` range silently excluded the sentinel.

Percentiles: computed within (season, category) among **qualified** players
(thresholds: Passing ≥ 150 attempts, Rushing ≥ 80 carries, Receiving ≥ 40 targets,
Defense ≥ 300 defensive snaps or ≥ 8 games). Inverted metrics: lower raw value = higher
percentile. Percentile int 1–100. `value` is the formatted raw stat string (e.g. "4,918", "68.3%").
A player appears in every category they qualify for (rushing QB gets Passing + Rushing metrics).
The nflverse target field is effectively blank for 2003–2008. Those seasons use
≥ 25 receptions (≥ 3 postseason) as the receiving qualification and omit
target-derived metrics instead of presenting fabricated zeroes.

## metrics jsonb element shape (same as baseball)
`{"id": "...", "label": "...", "value": "...", "percentile": 87, "category": "Passing"}`

## standard_stats jsonb
`[{"id": "...", "label": "...", "value": "..."}]` — games, totals per relevant categories
(G, Cmp/Att, Yds, TD, INT for QB; Car, Yds, TD for RB; Rec/Tgt, Yds, TD; etc.)

## games jsonb (snapshot) — keep same shape as baseball
`[{"id","date","opponent","summary","percentile_delta","key_metric"}]` — may be empty [].

## player_game_logs
One row per player per game and season type (per side: player_type as above). `game_date` from schedule
`gameday`. `plays` = pass attempts + carries + targets (offensive involvement),
`touches` = completions + carries + receptions. `metrics` jsonb: flat dict of per-game raw
stats (passing_yards, passing_tds, interceptions, rushing_yards, carries, receptions,
targets, receiving_yards, epa_total, ...). `player_recent_form` powers Trends using
league-anchored 3/5/8-week windows, so an inactive player does not retain a stale
player-relative "last N games" result.

## Teams
32 NFL abbreviations (nflverse): ARI ATL BAL BUF CAR CHI CIN CLE DAL DEN DET GB HOU IND

## Free vs Pro season gating (iOS)
- `StatScoutSeason.current = 2025`, `free = 2025`, `oldest = 2000`; historical seasons (Pro) = 2000–2024.
- Backend backfills regular-season and postseason snapshots for seasons 2000–2025.
  Earlier seasons omit unavailable NGS-only metrics instead of emitting zero values.
- Historical game logs are not bulk-backfilled; Recent Form remains an active-season feed.
